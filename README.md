This is a implementation taken directly from the excellent tutorial of Tim Corey. Here is the link to his youtube video:

and to his website:

It covers the following concepts:

1. ADO.NET to connect via C# code (in Visual Studio 2019) to a SQL database
2. Dapper as an object mapper for ADO.NET data reader (https://dapper-tutorial.net/dapper)
3. WinForm GUI
4. Utilization of stored procedures in SQL Server Management Studio to ensure a safe connection
5. Reading from a database by a search term for a particular column in T-SQL
6. Writing to (INSERT) the database in T-SQL
